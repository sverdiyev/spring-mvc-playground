instructions from gpt:

To create a simple "Hello World" API using Spring MVC without Spring Boot, follow these steps:

Set up your project structure:

Create a new Java project in your preferred IDE.
Add the required dependencies manually. You'll need the following dependencies:
Spring Core
Spring MVC
Jackson (for JSON serialization/deserialization)
Servlet API
Create the necessary configuration files:

Create a web.xml file in the WEB-INF folder. This file serves as the deployment descriptor for your web application.
Configure the DispatcherServlet in the web.xml file by mapping it to the root URL ("/") or a specific URL pattern.
Create the Spring configuration file:

Create a Spring configuration XML file (e.g., spring-config.xml) in the WEB-INF folder.
Configure the DispatcherServlet in the XML file using the <mvc:annotation-driven> element.
Create the controller:

Create a Java class and annotate it with @Controller.
Define a method in the class and annotate it with @RequestMapping("/") to handle the root URL.
In the method, create a HashMap or a POJO object with the "Hello World" message.
Use the @ResponseBody annotation on the method to indicate that the returned value should be serialized to the response body as JSON.
Here's an example of how the code would look:

java
Copy code
import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.ResponseBody;

@Controller
public class HelloWorldController {

    @RequestMapping("/")
    @ResponseBody
    public HashMap<String, String> helloWorld() {
        HashMap<String, String> response = new HashMap<>();
        response.put("message", "Hello World");
        return response;
    }
}


Build and deploy your project:
Build your project to generate the WAR file.
Deploy the generated WAR file to a servlet container, such as Apache Tomcat or Jetty.
Start the servlet container and access your "Hello World" API using the configured URL pattern.
